# @deepseek-ai/dsh-web-fetch-http

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

An anonymous public HTTP(S) `WebFetchProvider` for the harness [web capability seam](../web/README.md) (`ctx.web`). It retrieves a concrete URL and returns a status code plus bounded decoded content.

This is an **implementation** package: it registers a provider into `ctx.web`, it does not own the key and it does not register a model-facing tool. It is a function/namespace plugin (`inject: ['web']`).

## Responsibility split

The provider owns **safe resource retrieval**: URL validation, HTTP transport, redirect policy, a resource-backstop timeout, abort propagation, byte caps, charset decoding, content-type classification, and binary rejection. `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-web` owns **presentation** (HTML→markdown, truncation formatting). A non-2xx HTTP response is a *result* (status code + decoded body), not an error; `WebError` is reserved for failures to safely retrieve or represent the resource.

The provider's `timeoutMs` is a resource backstop for direct `ctx.web.fetch()` callers and misconfigured deployments, not the model-facing tool-call budget. [`dsh-tool-call-timeout-policy`](../../guard/timeout-policy/README.md) owns the `web_fetch` tool-call budget by arming `exec.signal`.

A shipping web-tool deployment sets the provider backstop above the tool budget, so model calls normally return `TOOL_TIMEOUT`. If the outer deadline reaches the provider first, the provider reports `WEB_ABORTED` and the outer policy replaces it with `TOOL_TIMEOUT`. `WEB_FETCH_TIMEOUT` therefore identifies a direct service caller whose provider budget elapsed.

## Transport hygiene

- Accepts only `http:` and `https:` URLs; rejects credentials in URLs (`WEB_BLOCKED_URL`) and over-long/malformed URLs (`WEB_INVALID_URL`).
- Enforces a max URL length, response byte cap (`WEB_FETCH_TOO_LARGE`), decoded body character cap, timeout (`WEB_FETCH_TIMEOUT`), and redirect hop cap.
- Propagates the caller's abort signal (`WEB_ABORTED`) into the network request and the streaming read.
- Retries transport failures within the single provider deadline, rotating the already validated address set between attempts; HTTP responses and safety failures are never retried.
- Follows only **same-origin** redirects; a cross-origin redirect fails with `WEB_REDIRECT_BLOCKED`, requiring a fresh tool call (the model of Claude Code's WebFetch).
- Sends an explicit product `User-Agent`, never a browser disguise.
- Rejects unsupported (e.g. binary) content types with `WEB_UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT_TYPE`.
- Resolves every initial and same-origin redirect hostname as A/AAAA records, rejects any non-public answer (`WEB_BLOCKED_URL`), and pins the verified address for the connection to prevent DNS rebinding.
- Maps public GitHub repository roots to the anonymous GitHub README API and GitHub or `raw.githubusercontent.com` file URLs to the anonymous GitHub Contents API, while retaining the submitted URL in the result. This uses GitHub's raw response media type, keeps the same destination, timeout, size, and content-type checks, and lets an API 403 enter an explicitly configured fetch fallback.

## Config

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `maxUrlLength` | `2048` | Maximum accepted request URL length. |
| `maxResponseBytes` | `5_000_000` | Maximum response body size in bytes. |
| `maxBodyChars` | `100_000` | Maximum decoded body length in characters. |
| `timeoutMs` | `30_000` | Fetch timeout within Node's timer range — a resource backstop for direct `ctx.web.fetch()` callers, not the model-facing tool-call budget (that is `dsh-tool-call-timeout-policy`). |
| `maxRedirects` | `5` | Maximum same-origin redirect hops (`0` follows none). |
| `maxAttempts` | `3` | Maximum transport attempts within the single `timeoutMs` deadline. |
| `userAgent` | `deepseek-harness/…` | `User-Agent` header. |

The numeric limits are validated at plugin construction: byte, character, URL, and timeout caps must be positive finite numbers; `maxRedirects` must be a non-negative integer; and `maxAttempts` must be a positive integer. An invalid value throws rather than silently constructing a provider with nonsensical limits.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through [`dsh-tool-web`](../tool-web/README.md), which places this provider's `maxBodyChars`-bounded decoded text or markdown-shaped HTML under its fetch-result wrapper and retains provider failures while redirects, headers, and transport mechanics remain hidden.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct invalidation; the named consumer owns any request-prefix changes.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Only textual content decodes** — html/xhtml and `text/*`-plus-JSON/XML families; a missing `Content-Type` or any binary type throws `WEB_UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT_TYPE`, and text-extractable PDF decoding is named deferred work.
- **Charset comes only from the `Content-Type` header** (UTF-8 default) — an HTML `<meta charset>` declaration is ignored, and a declared-but-unrecognized charset label throws rather than falling back.
